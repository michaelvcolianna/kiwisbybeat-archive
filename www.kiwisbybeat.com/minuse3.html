<center><tr><td bgcolor=99AAEE><font color=ffffff><font size="3"><b><center>Hi! The comic ended three weeks ago for anyone still not yet aware, so I'm running
some extra comics for the rest of the month.<a href="prints.html">I'm also taking the last round of print orders this month,</a> and I guess  the 31st will be the last day for that. Thanks to everyone who has ordered some so far. If this is your first 
time here, you should probably <a href="minus1.html">start from the beginning</a>. <br><br> I guess this is the last week for extra comics, so this is my last update here. Anyways this weeks comics were for unused plans related to the bathroom kingdom storyline. The original idea for that was to just show a character enter the bathroom and then come out older in full body armor or something and then... I don't know, walk around town and wreck up the place. The story ended up focusing on what happened inside the bathroom though, but the red haired girl learned to fight and everything so I still wanted her to wreck up a few places before the comic ended. At least a little bit. The first plan was to give her a bully to beat up on:<br><img src="minus/me3a.jpg"><br><br> The comic was too cluttered though and I didn't have room to fit in the ending I wanted so I decided to redo it later, which I never got around to and so I eventually came up with a new plan for her to beat up on something. I had an idea for a comic where minus shows up some street magician so he gets angry and tries to attack her in her dreams(maybe minus gave him real powers while screwing around in the past, I didn't really think it through) and the resulting nightmares could lead to monsters in the real world... monsters that could be beaten up with sticks. Except by the time I got to actually drawing the comics the entire original idea was scrapped, so it ended up just being stuff popping out of minus's dream for no reason:<br><br><img src="minus/me3b.jpg"><br><br><img src="minus/me3c.jpg"><br><br>which I couldn't really use but still kind of wanted to, so I thought I could tie it to the other thing I wanted to get in before the comic ended:<br><br><img src="minus/me3d.jpg"><br></br>but even another Larry Comic couldn't save it. I was able to get Larry in one last time though. Actually at one point "Larry is Doing Fine: The continuing adventures of the last man on earth" was going to be the official final comic. It was competing with "legs sure are ridiculous"(the winner!) and a comedy routine by minus and her friend about why they wished they were fish. With that one they would have been able to bow in the last panel or something. So anyways, in the end the red haired girl never was able to show off her fighting skills. She was supposed to though. Also, before that, she was supposed to have her head chopped off:<br><br><img src="minus/me3e.jpg"><br><br>

<tr><th bgcolor=99AAEE width=200><font color=ffffff>About the comic:<p><font size="2">Each minus strip is painted on a 15x20" piece of Illustration board. With this comic I am pretending I am making a comic strip for a newspaper in the early 20th century. A special newspaper that lets me use as much color as I want, because real papers have limitations on that sort of thing. Or maybe they did in the past I'm not sure!

24/7/08-<a href="shell1.html" target=blank>Here is the new comic I mentioned last week</a>. It's already complete though and most comics I start after this point will be like that one and not go online until they're finished so while I'm working on new stuff it probably won't go up until some point in 2009. I guess that's it! SEE YOU AGAIN.
